The purpose of the data files saved here is to record current/time measurements for the UVLED + Photodiode measurement setup. Each file contains a header, where the most relevent information is stored. This header contains:
	* Parameters passed to the UVLED - (UVLED Amplitude = "ampl" or current pulse amplitude in mA, UVLED Width = "width" or pulse width in microseconds)
	* Information received from the UVLED - (UVLED ID = "ID" or the unique id associated with the unit used, UVLED Amplitude Readback = "amprb" or the actual current pulse amplitude measured by the LED, and the temperatures measured by the UVLED using "temp")
	* The frequency value passed to the pulse generator which triggers the LED externally (Pulse Frequency)
	* The measured distance between the LED diffuser and the photodiode precision aperture, incorrectly spelled as Seperation - this is passed as a parameter to the measurement software, and is measured by hand, using calipers.
	* The average current and standard deviation of that current obtained from the picoammeter (Average Current and Current StD respectively)

These last two values (Current Avg, Current StD) are calculated from the set of current/time points which makes up the end of the data file. This "footer" contains all of the raw data provided by the picoammeter.
